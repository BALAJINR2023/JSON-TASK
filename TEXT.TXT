*******In JavaScript, window, screen, and document are objects that represent different aspects of the browser environment.
Here's a brief overview of each:

<---window Object:
The window object represents the global browser window or tab.It is the top-level object in the browser's object model and acts as a global scope for JavaScript code running in a browser.
Properties and methods related to the browser window can be accessed through the window object.
Commonly used properties include window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight to get the inner width and height of the browser window.

<---screen Object:
The screen object represents the user's screen or monitor.
It provides information about the user's screen, such as width, height, and color depth.
Properties like screen.width and screen.height can be used to get the width and height of the user's screen.

<---document Object:
The document object represents the HTML document loaded in the browser window.
It provides access to the content of the document and allows manipulation of the HTML elements on the page.
Methods like getElementById() and properties like document.title are commonly used to interact with the document.

    In summary, window is the top-level object representing the browser window, screen represents the user's screen, and document represents the HTML document loaded in the browser. 
These objects are part of the Document Object Model (DOM) and provide ways to interact with and manipulate the browser environment using JavaScript.
